Believing that they no longer required us, they would eventually come to lose their faith. They grew as a people, finding new strength and confidence in their technology. This was unfortunately short-lived, and at the hands of this technology suffered a great disaster. The people’s numbers were reduced to near extinction. <br /><br />

They once again sought our guidance, our help, and through a mixture of our own boredom and intrigue, we gods descended from the heavens to join you, our children, in the mortal realm. Over time we have rebuilt our relationship, and together we have rebuilt this world into what it is today, a world of opportunity and relative peace. <br /><br />

Together, we can now seek out new experiences. Your cultures, relationships and adventures would serve as our... entertainment. We wanted new experiences, ones that simply were impossible in our otherwise “perfect” domains. As such we have decided to live with you, for the rest of eternity. Of course, this means relinquishing our divinity, our divine powers. With these locked away our lives would not be as convenient, simple or as easy as they once were. We believed that this trade off would be worth it, and vowed to live a determined, happy and normal life with both its hardships and its rewards. Fortunately for you, we are still able to offer one thing: our blessing. Those who receive this blessing become our servants, join our familia, in other words, you become our kin. <br /><br />
